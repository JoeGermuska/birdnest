# birdnest
A little project around our JQBX group

This could give some good ideas for SQLite tricks https://antonz.org/sqlite-is-not-a-toy-database/

Maybe interesting: https://github.com/adithyamrao/Spotify-Data-Analysis

Technologies used:

* Flask/Jinja
* SQLAlchemy
* SQLite
* [Sortable](https://github.hubspot.com/sortable/) JS library
* Spotipy
* Pandas (maybe not in the actual app?)
